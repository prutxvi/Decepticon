"""Push background-job completion notices into the agent message stream.

When a tmux session's background command finishes, prepend a HumanMessage
with a <system-reminder> tag describing the completion. Anthropic models
recognize this tag as a runtime signal (the same pattern Claude Code uses)
without treating it as a real user turn.

Hook: before_model — runs every turn, so the agent learns about completions
on its very next inference even if it didn't poll bash_output.
